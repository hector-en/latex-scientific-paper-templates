Now that we have our mathematical model, we can examine what happens at equilibrium conditions, when the net change in Species consuption vs. creation is 0: $\frac{d}{dt} = 0$. 
\steadystate{Steadystate Analysis.}
With the ODE in \fullref{Box:2} we can solve the equation using Python.

\fullref{fig:figure2} (a) is showing a successfull digestion for all plasmids. The virtual digestions  where layed over the original gel image, perfectly aligning in silico and in vivo outcomes. Part b shows a high number of incorrect flourecence profiles accross all groups exept of
of G1, which is very close to the control. This results indicates a low accuracy (c) as seen in the diagram below. The total incauracy is 65.58 \% $\pm$ 0.88\% (D4) and 1.8\% $\pm$ 6.2\% (DC).

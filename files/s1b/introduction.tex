\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{color2}D}NA Assebly is key in genetic engineering, genome editing or automation.
Restriction enyzme based methods were introduced in 1990, with significant challenges in residual DNA fragments after digestion\cite{Ellis2011}, flexibiliy of target DNA sequences. Subsequent variants such as the Gibson Assembly (isothermal) or Golden Gate (multipart, Type II restriction enyzmes) \cite{Storch2015}, were still limited.
The Biopart Assembly Standard for Idempotent CLoning (BASIC) eliminates scars and specificity issues via othogonal linkers, which do not interfere with the DNA sequence, leading to scar-less cloning\cite{Storch2017}. 
{\footnotesize\linkerfig{0.8}{\footnotesize \textbf{Linker and Adaptors:} Modular linkers consists of a 37bp linker section and 12bp long adapter section, designed as a DNA part internal prefix (iP) and suffix (iS).  
The 4bp BasI annealing region (CTCG, GGAC) is located at the 5 prime end of the linker section (CTCG, GGAC). The linker anneals at the 5 prime end with the DNA parts and at 3 prime orthogonally with eachother to form the reulting 45 bp long final linker.

The linkers are reusable and rendering the assemly method as an automated high throughput mehtod \cite{Storch2015,Storch2017}.
\newline In this practical we are using two neutral linkers (L1, L2) and two iternal linker containing methylated prefix and suffix (LMiP,LMiS)\fullref{fig:figure2}. {\footnotesize\basicfig{0.8}{\footnotesize \textbf{BASIC Assembley Steps:} Figure outlines digestion, purification, and annealing steps. Digestion and purification reactions are performed in seperate wells. Assembly is performed in one mixture.

Neutral linkers as a DNA part prefix (L1P, L2P) and suffix (L1S, L2S). The methylated linkers are designed as 2x2 set of Linkers for the Methylation prefix and suffix  (2xLMP,2xLMS), binding to the DNA parts. 
Each pair of LMP,LMS is further comprised of a orthogonal prefixes (-P) and suffixes (-S) which bind to eachother LMP-S, LMP-P and LMS-S, LMS-P. The adaptors are methylated at the 5 prime end for the prefix (LMP-P-A) and suffix (LMS-S-A) linkers. These methylations serve as a protection from DNA Ligase in the digestoin-ligations steps.
%3. Objective of Your Study
Our Objective is to evalutate the accuracy of a four part BASIC assembly process, consisting of Canamicin resistant DNA part (Kan-Ori); a Chloramphenicol resistance casette (CaR) and two flourecence cassttes (RFP, and GFP) \fullref{fig:figure2}.
First the DNA part containing plasmids are digested in four parallel reactions where DNA ligase cuts the plasmids at the BSaI site within the LMiP/S linkers \fullref{fig:figure2}.
